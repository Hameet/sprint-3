What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to 550px?

The layout changes and aligns itself accordingly with shrinkage in the size. The layout adjusts so that it fits in the screen. 
This is done by using the "media queries" module which allows to build responsive webpages. I think I understand the concept to an extent but am unable to describe it better.
